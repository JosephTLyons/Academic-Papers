# Academic-Papers
This is a repository that simply contains a small selection of my academic
papers, hard-wrapped to 80 characters.

There is no single formatting style for these papers, each one was formatted
specifically to meet the requirements of the class they pertained to.

All wrapping was done with [`autoflow`](atom.io autoflow) and all center
aligning was done with [`text-align`](https://atom.io/packages/text-align).

These papers were never professionally edited, so mistakes are bound to exist.  
If you find a mistake and would like to help, you may open a pull request (if
you'd like credit) or simply email me at JosephTLyons(AT)gmail(DOT)com.
