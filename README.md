# Academic-Papers
This is a repository that simply contains a small selection of my academic papers, hard-wrapped to 80 characters.

These papers were never professionally edited, so mistakes are bound to exist.  If you find a mistake and would like to help, you may open a pull request (if you'd like credit) or simply (email me)[JosephTLyons@mgmail.com].
