# Academic-Papers

This repository contains a small selection of my academic papers, hard-wrapped
to 80 characters.

There is no single formatting style for these papers, each one was formatted
specifically to meet the requirements of the class they pertained to.

All wrapping was done with [`autoflow`](https://atom.io/packages/autoflow) and
all center aligning was done with
[`text-align`](https://atom.io/packages/text-align).

These papers have not been professionally edited, so mistakes are bound to
exist.  If you find a mistake and would like to help, you may open a pull
request (if you'd like credit) or simply email me at
JosephTLyons(AT)gmail(DOT)com.
