# Academic-Papers

This repository contains a small selection of my academic papers, hard-wrapped
to 80 characters.

There is no single formatting style for these papers, each one was formatted
specifically to meet the requirements of the class they pertained to.

All wrapping was done with [`autoflow`](https://atom.io/packages/autoflow) and
all center aligning was done with
[`text-align`](https://atom.io/packages/text-align).

Aside from small typographical fixes, the contents of these papers have not been
updated since they were written; the papers may be out of date, may contain
invalid information, or may not reflect my current opinions or skill sets.  Feel
free to open a pull request if you spot any errors.
